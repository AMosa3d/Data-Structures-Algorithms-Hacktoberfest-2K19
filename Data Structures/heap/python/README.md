**A simple example of Binary Minimum Heap Data Structure coded in Python.**

Inspired from : 

- https://youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA , very easy and useful.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)

**Note :**

- the expand function might be not a mandatory here in python but in case you wanted to implement it in other languages, you still might need it or understand it at least if you are not very familiar with heaps.
